Version 1.0

MainFrame.java is the main file to be opened.

There are two tabs - 1. Distributed Environment (hence forth DE) and 2. Query Input (hence forth QI).

DE: This tab contains the configuration details for database(s) schema(s) and distributed environment and Network configuration details.
First time users may need to enter the database schema by click to enter details. This will open to another frame that allows you to add database details.

Please remember to enter number of multiple databases you are trying to enter.
Each row in the table in this frame should have table name on the left handside column and attributes to be entered separated by comma.
At the moment there is provision to  enter 20 tables with 20*20 attributes. If need be, more facilities will be added in  later versions.
IMPORTANT: Please remember to select an empty cell after adding all tables and attributes names. Otherwise, the selected cell's values are not going to be added.
This is a bug and will be handled in V2. Save one database at a time.
Finally after adding all databases carefully please click the 'Generate XML file' which will generate a serialized file for portability
and allows you to save that file at a location of your choice. You can use this schema file later to generate workloads.

Now, in the DE, please add other details. Otherwise, current default values will be considered for generating distributed environment.


QI Tab:
The second tab is Query inp[ut (QI)

QI generates one set of workload at a time. You may decide to divide your workload into number of epochs. This depends upon the variations
you would love to have in your workload. Once you select number of epochs, it will open a table of combo boxes for you to select for each epoch.
Enter the query arrival distribution from the given distributions, no.of queries for that epoch, the query repetition distribution and sub-query repetition.
Reset and Exit buttons are self explanatory. You can check the entered values in the table displayed next. If you want to change, you may do so.

Then click on the Generate workload button. This will generate one set of queries.

This is a preliminary working model and later versions will be made according to the needs that may arise.
